Sr.No	Exception & Description
1	std::exception
        An exception and parent class of all the standard C++ exceptions.

2	std::bad_alloc
        This can be thrown by new.

3	std::bad_cast
        This can be thrown by dynamic_cast.

4	std::bad_exception                                                              Need to re-check file_4.cpp
        This is useful device to handle unexpected exceptions in a C++ program.

5	std::bad_typeid                                                                 Need to re-check file_5.cpp
        This can be thrown by typeid.

6	std::logic_error                                                                Need to re-check file_6.cpp
        An exception that theoretically can be detected by reading the code.

7	std::domain_error                                                               Need to re-check file_7.cpp
        This is an exception thrown when a mathematically invalid domain is used.

8	std::invalid_argument                                                           Need to re-check file_8.cpp
        This is thrown due to invalid arguments.

9	std::length_error                                                               Need to re-check file_9.cpp
        This is thrown when a too big std::string is created.

10	std::out_of_range                                                               Need to re-check file_10.cpp
        This can be thrown by the 'at' method, for example a std::vector and std::bitset<>::operator[]().

11	std::runtime_error                                                              Need to re-check file_11.cpp
        An exception that theoretically cannot be detected by reading the code.

12	std::overflow_error                                                             Need to re-check file_12.cpp
        This is thrown if a mathematical overflow occurs.

13	std::range_error                                                                Need to re-check file_13.cpp
        This is occurred when you try to store a value which is out of range.

14	std::underflow_error                                                            Need to re-check file_14.cpp
        This is thrown if a mathematical underflow occurs.
